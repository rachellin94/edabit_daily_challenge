# Find the Discount
# Create a function that takes two arguments: the original price and the discount percentage as integers and returns the final price after the discount.
# Examples
# dis(1500, 50) âžž 750

    price = int(price)

    final_discount = 1 - discount 
    total_price = price * final_discount
    round_price = round(total_price, 2)
    return round_price
